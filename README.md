# Unreal.UE4SS.Reloaded

This is a fork of [Ryn's UE4SS Reloaded](https://github.com/WistfulHopes/Unreal.UE4SS.Reloaded) mod. Which allows UE4SS to run with reloaded 2. This fork expands on that to make UE4SS function like more of a typical reloaded 2 mod. 

Currently it lets you; 
- Load Blueprint Mods like proper reloaded 2 mods with UnrealEssentials (only P3R is supported right now, other games can be easily added though)
- Edit the UE4SS config within R2's configuration
- Allows the ue4ss log to be spit into the r2 log by enabling it in the config

Planned features; 
- Allow lua mods to function like r2 mods
- Allow per game support via an api
